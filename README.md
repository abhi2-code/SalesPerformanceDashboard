---

## 🧠 Insights & Interpretation

- **Notebooks** generated the highest total revenue, showing they are high-value items.
- **Erasers** had the highest number of units sold, indicating low-price, high-volume behavior.
- The forecasted revenue for the next 3 days shows a decline, signaling potential inventory or demand challenges.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical & Bias Considerations

- The dashboard uses a **short-term data sample**, which may not capture full seasonal or long-term trends.
- It assumes consistent demand patterns, ignoring **external factors** like promotions, holidays, or supply chain issues.
- Forecasts are **basic and trend-based**, not driven by machine learning or robust statistical models.
